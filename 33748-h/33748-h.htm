The Truth about Oleomargarine</h2>

<p>Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is a sweet, pure, clean, food
product made from rich cream and edible fats. It contains <em>every
element of nutrition</em> found in the best creamery butter.</p>

<p>The process of manufacture is primitive in its simplicity, but
modern in its cleanliness and purity.</p>

<p>The butter fat in Swift's Premium Oleomargarine is microscopically
and chemically <em>the same</em> as in the best butter; the only
difference is <em>in the way</em> it is secured from the cow.</p>

<p>Butter fat in butter is all obtained by churning. In Swift's
Premium Oleomargarine from ⅓ to ½ is obtained in that way,
the remainder is pressed from the choicest fat of Government inspected
animals. This pressed fat is called "Oleo" hence the
name "Oleomargarine."</p>

<p>Rich cream, fancy creamery butter, 'oleo' 'neutral,' vegetable
oil and dairy salt are the <em>only</em> ingredients of Premium Oleomargarine.
'Neutral' is pressed from leaf fat. It is odorless and
tasteless.</p>

<p>There is <em>no coloring matter</em> added to Premium Oleomargarine,
yet it is a tempting rich cream color.</p>

<p>Each week day during the year 1911 there has been an
average of more than 400 visitors through our Chicago Oleomargarine
Factory.</p>

<p>In addition to this daily inspection by the visiting public our
factories are in complete charge of Government Inspectors.</p>

<p>These men test the quality and character of materials, they
see that the contents of every tierce of 'oleo' and 'neutral' received
from the Refinery is from animals that have passed the rigid Government
inspection. They see that everything about the factories
is kept absolutely clean and sanitary.</p>

<p>Read what a Government expert said about Oleomargarine:</p>

<p>The late Prof. W. O. Atwater, director of the United States
Government Agricultural Experiment Station at Washington:</p>

<p>"It contains essentially the same ingredients as natural butter
from cow's milk. It is perfectly wholesome and healthy and has
a high nutritious value."</p>

<p>Order a carton of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine today
to try it. You will find that it is a delicious, wholesome food
product that you can use in your home and effect a great saving,
still maintaining your standard of good living.</p>

<p>We particularly invite you to visit our factories and see for
yourself the cleanliness surrounding this interesting industry.</p>

Recipes</h2>

<p class="hang">You can make exactly as good cakes, pies, cookies, and candies
by substituting for the butter named in your recipes ¾ the
quantity of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine. On this and
the following pages are a few recipes in which this substitution
has been made. Try them. You will find them good and
more economical than when made with butter.</p>

<p class="hang">You may have some favorite recipes that are too expensive on account
of the large amount of butter required. You can
reduce their cost by using Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.</p>

<h3>Loaf Fig Cake</h3>

<h4>Light Part</h4>

<ul>
<li>½ cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
<li>½ cupful sweet milk</li>
<li>1½ teaspoonfuls baking-powder</li>
<li>1 cupful sugar</li>
<li>1½ cupfuls flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful vanilla</li>
<li>Whites of 4 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang">Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the milk, with which
the vanilla has been mixed. Sift the baking-powder with the
flour and add gradually. Add the whites, well beaten, last.</p>

<h4>Dark Part</h4>

<ul>
<li>½ cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
<li>¾ cupful milk</li>
<li>1½ teaspoonfuls baking-powder</li>
<li>Yolks of 4 eggs</li>
<li>½ pound of raisins</li>
<li>1½ cupfuls sugar</li>
<li>3 cupfuls flour</li>
<li>1 dessertspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg</li>
<li>1 pound of figs</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang">Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the egg-yolks, well
beaten, then the milk. Sift the baking-powder and spices with
the flour and add gradually. The raisins should be seeded
and dredged with flour, and the figs should be cut in small
pieces and dredged with flour and added to the batter the
last thing. Put in the pan alternate layers of each part and
bake in a loaf.</p>

Sugar Cookies</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
<li>1 cupful sour milk</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful soda</li>
<li>2 cupfuls sugar</li>
<li>3 eggs, well beaten</li>
<li>Flavoring to taste</li>
<li>Flour enough to roll out thin</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang">Cream the oleomargarine and sugar. Add the eggs, whites and
yolks beaten together. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk.
Add this and then the flour. Roll out thin. Just before cutting
out the cookies sift granulated sugar on top and roll it in
slightly, then cut out cookies with cookie-cutter and bake in
a moderate oven.</p>

<h3>Lemon Pie</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 cupful sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls flour</li>
<li>Yolks of three eggs</li>
<li>1 cupful water</li>
<li>Juice and grated rind of 1 lemon</li>
<li>A lump of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine the size of an egg</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang">Put all together in an oatmeal cooker and cook over hot water
until thick. Take from the fire and cool a little. Line a
deep pie-plate with crust, pour in the lemon mixture, and
bake in a moderate oven until the crust is done. Remove
from the oven and have ready the whites of the three eggs,
beaten up stiff, with three level tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar; spread this meringue smoothly over the pie, return to
the oven, and bake a light brown.</p>

<h3>Cornbread</h3>

<ul>
<li>¼ cupful Swift's Premium Oleomargarine</li>
<li>1 cupful sweet milk</li>
<li>1 cupful cornmeal</li>
<li>¼ cupful sugar</li>
<li>1 cupful flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang">Sift together meal, flour, baking-powder, and sugar. To this
add in order the milk, the egg-yolks well beaten, the oleomargarine
melted and lastly the well-beaten whites of the eggs.
Bake in a hot oven for thirty to thirty-five minutes. This is
particularly delicious if just before it is done half a cupful of
cream is poured over the top.</p>

On Baking-Day</h2>

<p>When you wish a fine-grained cake, beat the whites of the
eggs to a stiff foam with a Dover egg-beater. If something spongy,
such as an angel cake, is desired, use a wire egg-beater, which
makes a more air-inflated foam.</p>

<p>Recipes in the older, much-prized cook-books often call for a
teacupful of yeast. A teacupful liquid yeast is equal to one cake
of compressed yeast.</p>

<p>To remove pecan meats whole, pour boiling water over nuts
and let them stand until cold. Then stand the nut on end and
crack with a hammer, striking the small end of the nut.</p>

<p>If beef or mutton drippings are used in making a pie-crust,
beat them to a cream with a teaspoonful of baking-powder and
the juice of half a lemon. This effectually removes all taste.</p>

<p>When a cake sticks to a pan, set it for a few minutes on a
cloth wrung out of cold water. It will then come out in good
shape.</p>

<p>Heat the blade of the bread-knife before cutting a loaf of fresh
bread. This prevents the usual breaking and crumbling of the
slices. For cutting hot fudge, first dip the blade of the knife in
boiling water.</p>

<p>Nothing is better for pudding molds than jelly tumblers with
light tin covers. One can readily tell when the puddings are
done without removing the covers.</p>

<p>The juice will not boil out of apple or berry pies if you dot
bits of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine near the outer edge.</p>

<p>A little salt in the oven under the baking-tins will prevent
burning on the bottom.</p>

<p>There is nothing more effective for removing the burned
crust from cake or bread than a flat grater. It works evenly
and leaves a smooth surface.</p>

<p>Use a wooden potato masher for stirring butter and sugar
together for a cake. It is much quicker than a spoon.</p>

Renovating Suggestions</h2>

<p><b>To clean a velvet suit</b>, sponge the spots with pure alcohol.
Then suspend the suit on a hanger in the bathroom in such a
way that the air can reach all sides of the garment. Turn on
the hot water in the tub until the steam fills the room; shut the
door and windows; shut off the water, and let the steam do its
work for an hour. Then admit the air, but do not touch the
garment until it is perfectly dry.</p>

<p><b>To remove shine from woolen goods</b>, use gentle friction
with emery paper. Rub just enough to raise the nap, and then
rub it over with a piece of silk.</p>

<p><b>To mend kid gloves</b>, first buttonhole around the rent not
so close as in a buttonhole; then overcast, taking up the thread
of the buttonhole on the edge, and then draw together.</p>

<p><b>To clean men's coat collars</b>, rub with a black stocking
saturated with grain alcohol. This will remove the greasy look.</p>

<p><b>To freshen a thin dress</b>, dissolve two teaspoonfuls of elastic
starch in half a cupful of lukewarm water, and with a soft rag
dampen on the right side, then with a hot iron press on the
wrong side.</p>

<p><b>To clean grease spots from silk</b>, split a visiting card and
rub the soft internal part on the spot on the wrong side of the
silk. The spot will disappear without taking the gloss off the silk.</p>

<p><b>To mend lace curtains</b>, take a small piece of net, dip it
and the curtains in hot starch, and apply the patch over the hole.
The patch will adhere when dry, and the repair will show much
less than if the curtains were mended.</p>

<p><b>To renew veils</b>, dip them in gum-arabic water, and pin
them out to dry as you would a lace curtain. When dry they
will look like new.</p>

<p><b>To freshen black taffeta or satin</b>, sponge with a cupful of
strong tea to which a little ammonia has been added. Then press
on the wrong side over a damp cloth.</p>

<p><b>To remove perspiration stains</b>, lay the stain over clean
white blotting-paper, and sponge with equal parts of alcohol and
ether mixed. Rub dry, then touch lightly with household ammonia.
If this leaves a blur, rub well with powdered French
chalk on the wrong side. The blotting-paper prevents the fluids
from forming a ring around the spot.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Page Nine]</a></span>
House-Cleaning Hints and Helps</h2>

<p><b>To clean linen shades</b>, lay them flat and rub with powdered
bath-brick.</p>

<p><b>To clean piano keys</b>, rub with muslin dipped in alcohol.
If the keys are very yellow, use a piece of flannel moistened
with cologne water.</p>

<p><b>To clean books</b> with delicate bindings, which are soiled
from handling, rub with chamois skin dipped in powdered pumice
stone.</p>

<p><b>To restore straw matting</b> which has become stained
or faded, wash with a strong solution of soda water. Use ordinary
baking soda and plenty of Swift's Pride Soap and wash thoroughly,
and when dry it will be found that the spots have all
disappeared and the matting is all one color.</p>

<p><b>To clean glass vases</b>, tea-leaves moistened with vinegar
will remove the discoloration in glass vases caused by flowers,
such as asters.</p>

<p><b>To clean windows and mirrors</b>, rub them over with
thin cold starch, let it dry on, and then wipe off with a soft cloth.
This will clean the glass and also give it a brilliant polish.</p>

<p><b>To remove paint</b> from window glass, use strong hot vinegar.</p>

<p><b>To remove white spots from furniture</b>, rub first with
oil, and then with slightly diluted alcohol.</p>

<p><b>To remove stains</b> from an enameled saucepan, fill with
water, add a little chloride of lime, and boil for a few minutes.</p>

<p><b>To clean willow-ware</b>, wash with salt water, using a brush.</p>

<p><b>To polish the globes</b> of gas and electric-light fixtures,
wash with water in which a few drops of ammonia have been
dissolved.</p>

<p><b>To clean tiling</b>, wipe with a soft cloth wrung out in soapy
water. Never scrub tiling, as scrubbing or the use of much water
will eventually loosen the cement and dislodge the sections.</p>

<p><b>To brighten nickel</b> trimmings on a gas stove, wash with
warm water, in which two tablespoonfuls of kerosene have been
stirred.</p>

<p><b>To save dusting</b>, a piece of cheese cloth about two yards
long placed on the floor in a freshly swept room will save much
of the usual dusting.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Page Ten]</a></span>
Laundry Helps</h2>

<p>A few cents' worth of powdered orris-root put in the wash
water will impart a delicate odor to the clothes.</p>

<p>Hot milk is better than hot water to remove fruit stains.</p>

<p>To remove spots from gingham, wet with milk and cover
with common salt. Leave for two hours, then rinse thoroughly.</p>

<p>In washing white goods that have become yellow, put a few
drops of turpentine into the water, then lay on the grass to dry
in the strong sunshine.</p>

<p>To make wash silk look like new, put a tablespoonful of
wood alcohol to every quart of water when rinsing and iron
while still damp.</p>

<p>When washing, if the article is badly soiled, use a small
scrubbing brush and scrub the goods over the washboard.</p>

<p>To set green or blue, mauve or purple, soak the articles for
at least ten minutes in alum water before washing them. Use an
ounce of alum to a gallon of water. To set brown or tan color,
soak for ten minutes in a solution made of a cupful of vinegar
in a pail of water. Black goods and black-and-white goods need
to be soaked in strong salt water, or to have a cupful of turpentine
put into the wash water. Yellows, buffs, and tans are made
much brighter by having a cupful of strong, strained coffee put
in the rinsing water.</p>

<p>When ironing fine pieces, instead of sprinkling afresh, take a
piece of muslin, wring it out in cold water, and lay on the ironing
board under the article; press with a warm iron; remove the
wet piece and iron.</p>

<p>When making starch for light clothes use Wool Soap in the
water. This will give the clothes a glossy appearance and the
irons will not stick.</p>

<p>Badly scorched linen may be improved by using the following
solution: Boil together well a pint of vinegar, an ounce of
Wool Soap, four ounces of fuller's earth, and the juice of two
onions. Spread this solution over the scorched spots on the linen
and let it dry. Afterward wash the garment and the scorch will
disappear.</p>

<p>To keep the clothes-line from twisting, hold the ball of rope
in one hand and wind with the other until a twist appears; then
change ball to the other hand and the twist will disappear. Keep
doing this, changing the rope from one hand to the other until
the line is all wound up.</p>

About House Plants</h2>

<p>To make ferns grow better, place some thin pieces of raw
beef close to the inside of the pot, between the pot and the soil.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned portulaca makes a pretty low-growing green
for a fern dish.</p>

<p>To prevent plants from dropping their buds, give extra good
drainage and systematic but moderate watering.</p>

<p>An infallible wash for destroying the scaly insects that infest
house plants is made as follows: Place half a bar of Swift's
Pride Laundry Soap in a deep saucer and pour kerosene around
it. Let this stand for about a week until the soap has absorbed
the oil. Then make a strong lather of this soap and with it
wash the plants. After which spray them with clear water until
clean.</p>

<p>To destroy aphis, shower foliage of infested plant on both
sides with strong tobacco tea, or, if the plant be small enough,
immerse it in this tea.</p>

<p>Insects in the earth of a potted plant may be destroyed by
pouring over the soil a glass of water in which a pinch of mustard

How to Use the Cheaper
Cuts of Meat</h2>

<p>Much time has been given in the last few years to the study
of foods, their necessary proportions, and the manner of cooking
them. Educators and scientists have alike agreed that this knowledge
ought to be disseminated. On the part of the public also
there has been a general awakening in this regard. There has
been a wide demand especially from those of limited incomes for
information on the purchase and preparation of foods. To meet
this demand books have been published and articles have appeared
in the various women's papers giving directions for living at all
sorts of prices, from the extremely low one, "How to Live on
Ten Cents a Day," to the normal one which requires the preparation
of appetizing and satisfying dinners at a nominal cost.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish living comfortably at small cost it is
evident that one must understand the comparative values of foods,
so as to select those which at low prices furnish the necessary
nourishment, and, also, be able to cook them in an appetizing
way which will conserve the nourishment. Meat is a necessity
to most people. Yet much of the present expense in the purchase
of meat is needless and unwise. Many pieces of meat of
the best quality are sold at low rates because not in shapes to
be served as roasting or broiling pieces. These serve well for
entrees or made-up dishes. Other pieces which are tough but
well flavored can, in the hands of an educated cook, be sent to
the table as tender, palatable, sightly and nutritious as the prime
cuts. It is to show some methods of preparing these cheaper
cuts of meat in an appetizing manner that the following explanation
of the processes of cooking and the accompanying recipes
are given.</p>

<p>Meat is cooked, first, to aid digestion; secondly, to develop
new flavors and render it more palatable.</p>

<p>For cooking there are three essentials besides the material to
be cooked&mdash;namely, heat, air, and moisture, the latter in the form
of water, either found in the food or added to it.</p>

<p>The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and bursts
starch grains, hardens albumen, and softens fiber.</p>

<p>Albumen is a substance like the white of an egg. It exists
in the juices of meat and contains much nourishment. If allowed
to escape, the nourishment is lost and the meat is hard.
Therefore we have the first general rule for the cooking of meat,
namely:</p>

<p><em>To retain the albumen, the outside of each piece of meat
should be seared or sealed at once before the cooking is continued.</em></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page Thirteen]</a></span>
Albumen is coagulated and hardened by intense heat.
Therefrom comes the second general rule, namely:</p>

<p><em>Intense heat hardens and toughens meat, while a soft moist
heat softens the fiber.</em></p>

<p>From these general rules we pass to the specific methods of
cooking meat, which are nine in number&mdash;broiling, roasting, baking,
frying, sauteing, steaming, boiling, stewing, or fricasseeing.</p>

<p>Broiling and roasting are practically the same, the chief difference
being in the time employed. Both mean to expose one
side of the meat to the fire while the other is exposed to the
air. By this method the meat is quickly seared and the nutritive
juices retained. Meat cooked in this way is richer and finer in
flavor.</p>

<p>Baking means cooking in a pan in the oven of a stove, and
in these days of hurry has largely superseded roasting.</p>

<p>Frying is the cooking by immersion in hot fat at a temperature
of 350 degrees Fahrenheit. There must be sufficient fat to
wholly cover each article. This method is employed for croquettes,
oysters, etc., and is less injurious to digestion than
sauteing.</p>

<p>Sauteing is cooking in a small quantity of fat, as an omelet
or hashed browned potatoes are cooked. This is the least wholesome
of all methods of cooking meat, and is often held directly
responsible for indigestion.</p>

<p>Steaming is an admirable method of cooking tough meats or
hams. Modern housewives use a "cooker," which comes for
this purpose, but the old-fashioned perforated steamer over a
kettle of boiling water is also good.</p>

<p>Boiling is one of the simplest methods of cooking the cheaper
cuts of meat. Properly employed, it consists in plunging the
whole piece of meat in a large kettle of rapidly boiling water.
The meat should be entirely covered by the water, which should
continue to boil rapidly for five minutes after the meat has been
immersed in it. The temperature of the water should then be
immediately lowered to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. If one has not
a cooking thermometer, one has only to remember that water
boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and it will easily be seen that
160 degrees is considerably below the boiling point.</p>

<p>Stewing or fricasseeing is really cooking slowly in a sauce
after the meat has first been browned in a little hot fat. If the
mixture is allowed to boil the meat will be tough and shriveled,
but if properly stewed it will be soft and easy to digest. Fricasseeing
is the most economical of all methods of cooking meat, as
there is very little loss in weight, and what is lost from the meat
is found in the sauce.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page Fourteen]</a></span>
Braising is a method much used in France, and is a cross
between boiling and baking. It is done in a covered pan in the
oven. The meat is first browned in a little hot fat and then
placed in a pan which is partly filled with stock or water. The
pan is covered closely and set in a hot oven. After ten minutes
the temperature of the oven is reduced to a very low point, and
the meat cooks slowly as the stock in the pan evaporates. This
method is the best for inferior pieces which require long, slow
cooking. It is an excellent method of cooking veal. Meat which
is lacking in flavor can be flavored by adding vegetables or herbs
to the stock in the pan.</p>

<p>Different cuts of meat require different methods of cooking
to bring about the best results. The following diagram and the
accompanying suggestions for proper cuts for certain methods of
cooking are those given by a prominent teacher in one of the
leading domestic science schools in the United States.</p>

The Practical Value and Use of
Fireless Cookers</h2>

<p>This twentieth century is the age of progress in many directions,
but most of all in Domestic Science. Never
before has so much attention been devoted to the home.
Journalists are giving columns of space to this topic.
Churches are directing their efforts to the betterment of the home.
Women's Clubs and charitable organizations have taken up the
study of the home. The most important result of all this action
and thought is the widespread awakening to the fact that the
social and moral standing of the home is directly dependent upon
its hygienic and economic condition.</p>

<p>In view of this fact, the National Federation of Women's
Clubs has practically covered the United States with their County,
State, and National Committees on Housekeeping. They know
that bad cooking in the home means unsatisfied stomachs, to
gratify whose cravings the saloons are filled; it means anemic
children, a physical condition that tends to produce criminals; it
means premature funerals. To remedy these evils, churches,
journalists, philanthropists, clubs are alike working, and all are
working along the same lines&mdash;that is, better home furnishings,
better fuels, better utensils, more efficient, more economic, and
less laborious methods of housekeeping. They have not only
sought and introduced new inventions, but they have studied the
past and adapted and bettered the old.</p>

<p>Among the adaptations of the old ideas with new and modern
improvements is the fireless cooker. Ages ago Norwegian
and German peasant women, obliged to be away from the house
all day working in the fields, knew the secret of bringing food
to the boiling point and then continuing its cooking and keeping
it hot by packing it in an improvised box of hay. In the
evening when the women returned, weary and worn from their
field labor, there was the family dinner all ready to serve.</p>

<p>German club women were the first to see the value of this
idea adapted to the needs of the German working class of the
present day. These German club women revived the hay boxes
and distributed numbers of them among poor families and began
an educational campaign on their use. The American manufacturer,
ever on the alert for ideas, was quick to perceive the economic
and commercial advantages of making such an appliance
in an up-to-date manner, and so to-day we have on the market
numerous fireless cookers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page Eighteen]</a></span>
The principle of fireless cooking, though it bears the difficult
name of recaloration, is simple enough. It is merely the retention
of heat through complete insulation, just as we retain cold
in the ice-box by complete insulation. In the first case, a material
which is a poor conductor of heat is interposed between the kettle
of hot food and the surrounding atmosphere to prevent radiation
or the escape of heat into the surrounding air. In the second
case, a poor conductor of heat is placed between the ice and the
warmer surrounding atmosphere to prevent the contact of the
atmosphere with the ice and the consequent equalization of temperatures.
A vacuum is an excellent non-conductor of heat and
is employed in the Thermos bottles advertised for use on automobile
trips, but a vacuum is expensive and difficult to obtain,
which accounts for the high price of Thermos bottles. The effort
has been to find some insulating agent within the means of
the average housewife. This has now been done in the metal-lined
cookers.</p>

<p>The explanation of the cooking principle is equally simple.
Ordinarily we heat food to a certain temperature, say, the boiling
point, and then we leave it over the fire for some time, not
to get hotter, that would be impossible, but to keep it at the same
degree of heat, and to do this we must, on account of radiation
into the surrounding atmosphere, keep on supplying heat. In
the fireless cooker the heat once generated is conserved, and there
is no need to add thereto.</p>

<p>Herein lies the economy in fuel. You have only to burn
gas long enough to bring the food to the boiling point, and the
fireless cooker does the rest. You can put dinner on to cook, and
go to work, to the theatre, to visit a friend, or read, or sew, without
giving your meal any further attention till time to serve it.
This sounds like a fairy tale, but it is absolutely true.</p>

<p>By the fireless cooker you save nine-tenths of the fuel, and
ninety-nine hundredths of your temper, your time, and your labor.
You do not become perspiring and cross in a hot kitchen.
You do not have scorched pots and kettles to scrape and scour
and wash.</p>

<p>Another point in favor of fireless cooking is that it is attended
by absolutely no odors. Such vegetables as onions and
cabbage can be cooked without any one's suspecting they are in
the house.</p>

<p>The economy in using the fireless cooker is not confined
solely to a saving in gas and labor. There is also an actual and
great economy in food, for there is almost no waste in this method
of cooking. Take for example a 5-pound piece of beef from the
round. Put this in the kettle of the fireless cooker with a pint of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page Nineteen]</a></span>
water for each pound of meat. Heat it on the gas range slowly,
taking about twenty minutes to bring it to the boiling point.
Then, according to directions, place it in the fireless cooker and
finish the cooking. When it is done and tender, it will be found
that there is only a minute loss in weight; to be exact, 2 ounces
for 5 pounds. You bought 5 pounds of meat and have to serve
on your table 4 pounds and 14 ounces. You could not make any
such showing if you had cooked the meat on a gas or coal range.</p>

<p>Four pounds and 14 ounces, however, is not all that you
have to serve. You originally added to your meat 5 pints of
water. A little of this evaporated or cooked away in the twenty
minutes primary cooking on the stove. All the rest is retained,
for there is absolutely no evaporation in a fireless cooker. This
water has added to it the nutritive value and flavor acquired
from the meat. So besides your 4 pounds and 14 ounces of meat
you have over 4 pints of rich soup stock which has cost you absolutely
nothing, as it is a by-product of the system of fireless
cooking.</p>

<p>"But," objects some one, "the meat cooked in such wise
will have lost all its juice and flavor." On the contrary, there is
a distinct gain in the matter of flavor in fireless cookery. We absolutely
know this to be so, for we have had various cuts of
meat, especially the cheaper cuts, cooked in a fireless cooker and
the dishes so prepared have been submitted to competent judges;
the opinion was unanimous that there was a real difference between
the flavor of meats so cooked and that of corresponding
cuts cooked after the usual methods, and that the delicacy and
richness of flavor lay with those meats cooked by the fireless
method.</p>

<p>When one understands the principles of cookery this richness
of flavor of meats cooked by the fireless method is not surprising.
Every one knows the proverbial deliciousness of French cookery.
The special peculiarity of the French cuisine is the long, slow
simmering of meats in closely covered earthen pots called casseroles.
The principle is essentially that of the fireless cooker,
but the casserole not being insulated, the French cook is obliged
to keep on supplying a sufficient degree of heat to keep the casserole
warm and its contents simmering.</p>

<p>Examples of fireless cooking with which many persons are
familiar by experience or hearsay are the foods cooked in primitive
ways, whose deliciousness is generally ascribed to the "hunger
sauce" that accompanies outdoor cookery. Among such examples
are the burying of the saucepan in a hole in the ground, the
cooking of food by dropping heated stones into the mixture, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page Twenty]</a></span>
the clambake known among the Narragansett Indians. In all
these cases we have the principle of the fireless cooker&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
closely-covered food slowly cooked at low temperature. Indeed,
one fireless cooker is constructed directly on the principle employed
in the New England clambake, and every one knows the
deliciousness of food so cooked has become proverbial.</p>

<p>By the fireless cooker the cheaper cuts of meat can be cooked
so that they are delicious, appetizing, tender. There is here a
distinct saving in money, for by the employment of the fireless
method of cooking, the cheaper cuts of meat can be made to serve
all the purposes of the higher-priced pieces. Further, if the meats
are stewed, boiled, or steamed, you also acquire at no cost whatever
as many pints of delicious soup stock, less one, as you have
pounds of meat.</p>

<p>Let us now recapitulate the advantages of fireless cooking:&mdash;</p>

<h3>A Fireless Cooker Saves Money</h3>

<p>1. Because by its use cheaper meats can be made to answer
as well as higher-priced cuts.</p>

<p>2. Because out of a given quantity of raw material you get,
after the cooking is done, more actual food than by any other
method.</p>

<h3>A Fireless Cooker Saves Fuel</h3>

<p>You have only to burn your gas twenty minutes for a 5-pound
piece of meat for fireless cooking, whereas by the usual
method you would burn the gas two to four hours, according to
the way you desired the meat cooked.</p>

<h3>A Fireless Cooker Saves Time</h3>

<p>Because you have only to watch the meat until it boils. By
the usual method you must attend to it all the hours it is on
cooking.</p>

<h3>A Fireless Cooker Saves Irritation and Worry</h3>

<p>For by this method of cooking the housewife knows that the
food cannot burn or overcook.</p>

<h3>A Fireless Cooker Adds to the Intellectual
Expansion and the Pleasures of
the Family</h3>

<p>Because it gives the mother time from her kitchen to oversee
the development of her children, and to share with them and
their father their pleasures and interests.</p>

<h3><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page Twenty-one]</a></span>
To the Wage-earning Woman</h3>

<p>the fireless cooker is a positive godsend. She can put food into
the cooker before going to work, and return to find her meal all
ready.</p>

<h3>If the Housewife Lives in the City</h3>

<p>and has to serve dinner at night all the preliminary cooking can
be done at noon, and the meal placed in the fireless cooker till
evening.</p>

<h3>To the Bachelor Girl</h3>

<p>who lives by means of a kitchenette, and must do her cooking
in what is at once parlor, bedroom and kitchen, what a blessing
is the absence of heat and odors that the fireless cooker assures.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>we quote from a bulletin published by the University of Illinois,
in which a study is made of the methods of roasting and cooking
meats. The authors found that there was no advantage in cooking
meat in a very hot oven (385 degrees Fahrenheit), but rather
a difficulty to keep it from burning; that in an oven which was
about 350 degrees Fahrenheit the meat cooked better; and that
in an Aladdin oven, which kept the meat at 212 degrees Fahrenheit,
it cooked best of all&mdash;that is, it was of more uniform character
all through, more juicy and more highly flavored. These
findings point to an advantage in fireless cooking, and Miss
Mitchell asserts that practical experience bears it out. With regard
to meats cooked in water in the cooker, Miss Mitchell asserts
that experience has shown that they become well done and
are more tender than when boiled, showing that the temperatures
necessary to reach that degree of cooking are obtained even
in the center of a large piece of meat, without toughening or
hardening the outside of the meat, as is done when more intense
heat is applied.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page Twenty-two]</a></span>
Recipes</h2>

<p>The following recipes are for the cheaper cuts of meat exclusively,
and employ one or another of the preceding methods.
Note that in all the recipes the two general rules for tender and
juicy meat are observed. The outside of the meat is first quickly
seared over to prevent the escape of the juices, and after the first
five minutes the heat is reduced so as not to harden the albumen.
Boiled or fricasseed meats should cook slowly. If meat is boiled
at a gallop the connective tissue is destroyed, the meat falls from
the bones in strings, and is hard and leathery.</p>

<p>For stews, meat en casserole, or in any fashion where water
is used in the cooking, select the round (5), either upper or
under. For boiling, the clod (9) or the round (5) or the
extreme lower piece of (3). For rolled steak, mock fillet,
steak à la Flamande, or beefsteak pie, the flank steak (7) is
best. For cheap stews use (10). For beef à la mode, in
a large family use a thick slice of the round (5), for a small
family the clod (9). For soup, use the shin or leg. For beef
tea, mince meat, and beef loaf, the neck is best. The chuck (1)
is used only for roasting or baking, and is good value only for a
large family. (2) and (3) are the standing ribs and carve to the
best advantage. The aitch or pin bone (in 3) is a desirable roast
for a large family. (3) is the loin, the choicest part of the
animal. From it come the fillet or tenderloin, the sirloin, and
the porterhouse steaks. (4) is the rump, from which come
good steaks for broiling.</p>

<li>2 pounds uncooked steak cut in pieces 2 inches square</li>
<li>1 cupful small white button onions</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful chopped parsley</li>

vegetables.</p>

<p class="hang">Put in an iron frying-pan over the fire to heat. When hot, rub
over the bottom with a piece of Swift's Premium Oleomargarine.
Lay in the pieces of steak and brown quickly on both
sides. Remove them from the frying-pan and arrange on the
vegetables in the casserole. Cover them with the remaining
vegetables. Sprinkle over the celery-seed, salt, and pepper,
and then pour the hot stock over all. Cover the dish and
bake for one hour in a quick oven.</p>

<p class="hang">Steak en Casserole should be sent to the table in the same dish
in which it is cooked. The steak should be brown and
tender, the vegetables slightly brown, and the stock nearly
all absorbed.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
